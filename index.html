                <div id="subtext">democratic citizen: one who not only participates in democracy as it is, but strives to make it what it could and should become</div>
                <p>After receiving a Physics Degree from the University of Michigan in 1997, I began teaching Physics in the city of Detroit.  My early experiences there, seeing the vast disparities between communities with and without resources, led to a lifelong interest in issues of equity and access for under-represented populations in higher education.
                </p>
                
                <p>After periods teaching in Germany and going back to U of M to pursue studies in Higher Education, I found myself teaching again at an urban school, this time in Kalamazoo, MI, and this is where I spent the majority of my teaching career.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the daily thrill of physics problem-solving, my career has offered the opportunity to continually work to understand and impact larger global issues alongside my students. Dewey, the great philosopher of education, described a school as a place to develop democratic citizens, and a democratic citizen is one who not only participates in democracy as it is, but who strives to make it what it could and should become.</p>

                <div id="subtext">Our future depends upon the ways in which we fallible humans come to interact with, implement, rely on, and control our technologies.</div>
                    
                <p>Now it is time personally for a new set of challenges.  The world is changing, and the pace of change is accelerating due to the ever-increasing role and power of technology in our lives.  We have great existential challenges facing us and the only way we will overcome these challenges is if normal citizens step up to help find the way. </p>
                <p>Our future depends upon the ways in which we fallible humans come to interact with, implement, rely on, and control our technologies. Never before in the history of humanity could so much damage be done to so many so easily. But, also true and often overlooked, is the fact that never before have we had the power to do so much good for so many.  </p>
